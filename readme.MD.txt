**Key Features:**
1. **Online Application:** Provides a user-friendly interface for students to submit their applications electronically.
2. **Document Management:** Allows for the secure storage and management of applicant documents, such as transcripts, recommendation letters, and personal statements.
3. **Application Tracking:** Enables applicants to track the status of their application and receive notifications regarding any updates or requests for additional information.
4. **Automated Communication:** Automates communication between the institution and applicants, reducing manual workload and ensuring timely responses to inquiries.
5. **Admission Decision Management:** Facilitates the review and evaluation of applications by admissions committees, leading to informed admission decisions.
6. **Enrollment Management:** Manages the enrollment process, including fee payment, course registration, and orientation scheduling.

**Technological Stack:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (or other frontend frameworks).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (or other backend frameworks), MongoDB (or other databases for data storage).
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for scalable and reliable hosting infrastructure.
- **Version Control:** Git for version control management, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for repository hosting.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI for automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- **Security:** Implement encryption protocols (SSL/TLS) for secure data transmission, adhere to OWASP security best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.

### Specifications:

**Functional Requirements:**
1. **User Authentication:** Allow users (applicants, administrators) to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.
2. **Application Submission:** Provide an interface for applicants to submit their applications, upload documents, and pay application fees (if applicable).
3. **Application Review:** Enable administrators to review and evaluate applications, assign scores, and make admission decisions.
4. **Communication:** Implement automated email notifications to keep applicants informed about their application status and any additional requirements.
